   A family of unimplemented computing languages is described that is intended to span differences of application area by a unified framework. This framework dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined names, and the conventions about characterizing functional relationships. Within this framework the design of a specific language splits into two independent parts. One is the choice of written appearances of programs (or more generally, their physical representation). The other is the choice of the abstract entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists of them, functional relations among them) that can be referred to in the language.

该文档描述了一个未实现的计算语言家族，旨在通过一个统一框架跨越不同应用领域的差异。该框架规定了关于用户创造的名称的使用规则，以及关于描述功能关系的惯例。在这个框架内，特定语言的设计分为两个独立部分。一个是程序的书面表现形式（或更广泛地说，它们的物理表示）的选择。另一个是可以在语言中引用的抽象实体（如数字、字符字符串、它们的列表、它们之间的功能关系）的选择。


The system is biased towards "expressions" rather than "statements." It includes a nonprocedural (purely functional) subsystem that aims to expand the class of users' needs that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing the important properties that make conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand. 


该系统偏向于"表达式"而不是"语句"。它包括一个非程序化（纯函数式）的子系统，旨在扩展用户的需求类别，这些需求可以通过单个打印指令来满足，而不会牺牲使传统右侧表达式易于构建和理解的重要属性

## 1. Introduction

Most programming languages are partly a way of expressing things in terms of other things and partly a basic set of given things. The IsWIM (If you See What I Mean) system is a byproduct of an attempt to disentangle these two aspects in some current languages. 

This attempt has led the author to think that many linguistic idiosyneracies are concerned with the former rather than the latter, whereas aptitude for a particular class of tasks is essentially determined by the latter rather than the former. The conclusion follows that many language characteristics are irrelevant to the alleged problem orientation. 

IsWIM is an attempt at a general purpose system for describing things in terms of other things, that can be problem-oriented by appropriate choice of "primitives." So it is not a language so much as a family of languages, of which each member is the result of choosing a set of primitives. The possibilities concerning this set and what is needed to specify such a set are discussed below.

IsWIM is not alone in being a family, even after mere syntactic variations have been discounted (see Section 4). In practice, this is true of most languages that achieve more than one implementation, and if the dialects are well disciplined, they might with luck be characterized as differences in the set of things provided by the library or operating system. Perhaps had ALGOL 60 been launched as a family instead of proclaimed as a language, it would have fielded some of the less relevant criticisms of its deficiencies

大多数编程语言在某种程度上是一种以其他事物的形式来表述事物的方式，同时也是一套基础的给定事物。ISWIM（如果你明白我在说什么）系统是尝试在一些当前语言中解开这两个方面的副产品。

这种尝试让作者认为，许多语言特性更多地与前者相关，而非后者，而对特定类别任务的适应性基本上由后者决定而非前者。所以得出的结论是，很多语言特性与所谓的问题导向无关。

ISWIM 是一种尝试，旨在通过选择适当的“原语”来描述事物与其他事物的关联性，从而实现面向问题的描述系统。因此，与其说它是一种语言，不如说是一种语言家族，其中每个成员都是选择一组原语的结果。下面讨论了与该集合有关的可能性以及指定此类集合所需的内容。

ISWIM 并不是唯一一个家族，即使在剔除了纯粹的语法变体之后（见第4节）。实际上，这对于实现了不止一种实现的大多数语言来说都是真实的，如果方言有很好的规范，那么它们可能被描述为由库或操作系统提供的一组事物的差异。也许如果 ALGOL 60 被作为一个家族推出，而不是被宣布为一种语言，它可能会避免一些不太相关的批评。

At first sight the facilities provided in IsWIM will appear comparatively meager. This appearance will be especially misleading to someone who has not appreciated how much of current manuals are devoted to the explanation of common (i.e., problem-orientation independent) logical structure rather than problem-oriented specialties. For example, in almost every language a user can coin names, obeying certain rules about the contexts in which the name is used and their relation to the textual segments that introduce, define, declare, or otherwise constrain its use. These rules vary considerably from one language to another, and frequently even within a single language there may be different conventions for different classes of names, with near-analogies that come irritatingly close to being exact. (Note that restrictions on what names can be coined also vary, but these are trivial differences. When they have any logical significance it is likely to be pernicious, by leading to puns such as ALGOL'S integer labels.)

So rules about user-coined names is an area in which we might expect to see the history of computer applications give ground to their logic. Another such area is in specifying functional relations. In fact these two areas are closely related since any use of a user-coined name implicitly involves a functional relation; e.g., compare

$ x(x+a) $

where $x = b -4- 2c$



$ f(b+2c) $

where $f(x) = x(x+a) $


ISWIM is thus part. programming language and part program for research. A possible first step in the research program is 1700 doctoral theses called "A Correspondence between x and Church's X-notation.

乍一看，ISWIM 提供的功能会显得相对较少。这种观点将尤其误导那些还没有意识到当前手册中有多少是专门用来解释常见（即，与问题导向无关）的逻辑结构，而非问题导向的特殊性的人。例如，在几乎每一种语言中，用户都可以创造名称，在名称使用的上下文以及它们和介绍、定义、声明或者以其他方式限制其使用的文本段落的关系方面遵循某些规则。这些规则从一种语言到另一种语言会有很大的差异，甚至在一种语言内也可能存在不同类别的名称的不同惯例，近似的类比会让人烦躁不安，因为它们接近于完全一致。（请注意，可以创造的名称的限制也会有所不同，但这些都是微不足道的差异。当它们具有任何逻辑意义的时候，可能会引起恶劣的效果，比如导致像 ALGOL 的整数标签那样的双关语。）


因此，关于用户创造的名称的规则是我们可以预期看到计算机应用程序的历史让位于其逻辑的领域之一。另一个这样的领域是在指定功能关系方面。事实上，这两个领域是密切相关的，因为任何使用用户创造的名称都隐含了一个功能关系。例如，比较一下。


$ x(x+a) $

where $ x=b-4-2c $

和

$ f(b+2c) $

where $ f(x)=x(x+a) $


因此，ISWIM 是编程语言的一部分，也是研究项目的一部分。研究项目的可能的第一步是 1700 篇名为“ x 与 Church's X-记法之间的对应关系”的博士论文。


## 2、The where-Notation

In ordinary mathematical communication, these uses of 'where' require no explanation. Nor do the following: 

$ f(b+2c) + f(2b-c) $


where $ f(x) = x(x+a) $

$ f(b+2c) + f(2b-c) $


where $ f(x) = x(x+a) $

and $b=\mu/(\mu+1)$

and $c=\nu/(\nu+1)$

$g(f$ where $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$,

$\mu/(\mu+1)$

$\nu/(\nu+1))$

where $g(f,p,q) = f(p+2q, 2p-q)$


A phrase of the form 'where definition' will be called a "where-clause." An expression of the form 'expression where-clause' is a "where-expression." Its two principal components are called, respectively, its "main clause" and its "supporting definition." To put 'where' into a programming language the following questions need answers


在普通的数学交流中，这些“where”的使用不需要解释。以下情况也不需要解释：


$ f(b+2c) + f(2b-c) $


where $ f(x) = x(x+a) $

$ f(b+2c) + f(2b-c) $


where $ f(x) = x(x+a) $

and $b=\mu/(\mu+1)$

and $c=\nu/(\nu+1)$

$g(f$ where $f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$,

$\mu/(\mu+1)$

$\nu/(\nu+1))$

where $g(f,p,q) = f(p+2q, 2p-q)$

一个形式为 “where definition” 的短语将被称为 “where子句”。一个形式为 “expression where-clause” 的表达式是一个 “where表达式”。它的两个主要组成部分分别被称为其“主句”和其“支持定义”。要将 “where” 放入编程语言中，需要回答以下问题：

Linguistic Structure. What structures of expression can appropriately be qualified by a where-clause, e.g., conditional expressions, operand-listings, statements, declarations, where-expressions?

Likewise, what structures of expression can appropriately be written as the right-hand side (rhs) of a supporting definition? What contexts are appropriate for a where-expression, e.g., as an arm of a conditional expression, an operator, the main-clause of a where-expression, the left-hand side (lhs) of a supporting definition, the rhs of a supporting definition?

Syntax. Having answered the above questions, what are the rules for writing the acceptable configurations unambiguously? E.g., where are brackets optional or obligatory? or other punctuation? or line breaks? or indentation? Note the separation of decisions about structure from decisions about syntax. (This is not a denial that language designers might iterate, like hardware designers who distinguish levels of hardware design.) 

Semantic Constraints on Linguistic Structure. In the above examples each main clause was a numerical expression; i.e., given appropriate meanings for the various identifiers in it, it denoted a number. What other kinds of meaning are appropriate for a mainclause, e.g., arrays, functions, structure descriptions, print-formats?

Likewise what kinds of meaning are appropriate for rhs's of supporting definitions? Notice there is not a third question analogous to the third question above under linguistic structure. This is because a where-expression must mean the same kind of thing as its main clause and hence raises no new question concerning what contexts are meaningful. Notice also that the questions about meaning are almost entirely independent of those about structure. They depend on classifying expressions in two ways that run across each other. 


语言结构。哪些表达式结构可以恰当地被一个 where 子句所修饰，例如，条件表达式，操作数列表，语句，声明，where 表达式？

同样，哪些表达式的结构可以适当地作为支持定义的右侧（rhs）编写？哪些上下文适合用where表达式，例如，作为条件表达式的分支，操作符，where 表达式的主从句，支持定义的左侧（lhs），支持定义的 rhs ？

语法。回答了上述问题后，如何写出可接受的配置的明确规则是什么？例如，括号是可选还是必需的？或者其他标点符号？或者换行符？或者缩进？请注意将关于结构的决定与关于语法的决定分开。（这并不是否认语言设计者可能会像区分不同级别的硬件设计的硬件设计者一样进行迭代。）

对语言结构的语义约束。在上述例子中，每个主从句都是一个数值表达式；也就是说，给定其中各种标识符的适当含义，它表示一个数字。主从句适合什么其他类型的含义，例如，数组，函数，结构描述，打印格式？

同样，支持定义的 rhs 适合哪种类型的含义？注意，没有与上述语言结构下的第三个问题类似的第三个问题。这是因为 where 表达式必须表示与其主从句相同类型的东西，因此不会引起关于哪些上下文是有意义的新问题。还要注意，关于意义的问题几乎完全独立于关于结构的问题。它们依赖于以彼此交叉的两种方式对表达式进行分类


Outcome. What is the outcome of the more recondite structural configurations among those deemed admissible, e.g. mixed nests of where-expressions, function definitions, conditional expressions, etc.?

Experimental programming has led the author to think that there is no configuration, however unpromising it might seem when judged cold, that will not turn up quite naturally. Furthermore, some configurations of 'where' that might first appear to reflect somewhat pedantic distinctions, in fact provide close matches for current language features such as name/value and own (see [2, 3]).

All these questions are not answered in this paper. The techniques for answering them are outlined in Section 4

One other issue arises when 'where' is added to a programming language-types and specifications. A method of expressing these functionally is explained in [2]. It amounts to using named transfer-functions instead of class names like integer, i.e., writing

where $ n = round(n) $

instead of the specification

integer $ n $ 

Thus the use of functional notation does not jeopardize the determination of type from textual evidence


结果。在那些被认为可接受的结构配置中，更难以理解的结构配置的结果是什么？例如混合的where表达式、函数定义、条件表达式等的嵌套结构。

实验编程使作者认为，无论某种配置看起来多么不具前景，只要进行实际尝试，它都会自然地出现。此外，一些初看起来可能显得有些学究气的'where'配置，实际上与当前的语言特性（如名称/值和own）非常匹配（参见[2, 3]）。

所有这些问题在本文中都没有得到解答。回答它们的技术在第4节中有所概述。

当'where'添加到编程语言中时，还会出现其他问题——类型和规范。在[2]中解释了这些功能性表达的方法。这就像使用命名转移函数而不是像整数一样的类名，即，编写


where $ n = round(n) $

而不是类型

integer $ n $ 

因此，使用函数符号并不会危及从文本证据中确定类型。
