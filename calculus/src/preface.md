# 前言

> A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the solution of any problem. you problem may be modest, but if it challenges your cruiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.

> 一个伟大的发现可以解决一个重大的问题，但是解决任何小问题，总会有一丝的发现。你解决的问题可能很简单，但是如果它挑动了你的好奇心，可以激发你的创造力，并且你可以通过自己的方式解决它，那么你可能会经历发现的紧张和胜利的喜悦。

## 一、preferable

前言

The art of teaching, Mark Van Doren said, is the art of assisting discovery. I have tried to write a book that assists students in discovery calculus —— both for its practical power and its surprising beauty. In this edition, as in the first seven editions, I aim to convery to the student a sense of the utility of calculus and develop technical competence, but I alao strive to give some appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of the subject

Newton undoubtedly experienced a sense of triumph when he made his great discoveries. I want students to share some of that excitement.

Mark Van Doren 曾经说过, 教学的艺术，就是帮助学生发现的艺术，我试图写一本书，帮助学生发现微积分的实用和美感。在第8版本中，正如前面的7版一样，我旨在让学生感受到微积分的实用性，并且发展技术能力。但是，我同时也努力让学生发现这一个学科的内在美。当牛顿做出伟大发现时候，无疑感受到巨大的喜悦。我希望学生们也可以感受到同样的喜悦。

The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agress that this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the curent calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which formulated as their first recommendation:

<p align="center"> Focus on conceptual understanding. </p>

重点在于理解概念，我觉得所有人都会认同这个教学目标。实际上，当前微积分改革运动的主要推动力量来自于1986年的图兰大会，这次大会将第一项建议指制定为

<p align="center"> 关注概念的理解 </p>

I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: 

Topices should be presented geometrically, numerically, and algebraically.

Visualization, numberical and graphical experimentation, and the approaches have changed how we teach conceptual reasoning in fundamental ways. 

More recently, the Rule of Three has been expanded to become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as well.

我将通过三个法则实现这个目标，一个主题应该从几何、数值和代数的角度进行呈现。可视化、数值和图形实验、方法，从根本上改变了我们教授概念推理的过程。

最近，这3个规则已经拓展为4个规则了，添加了可观测的角度。

In writing the eight edition my premise has been that it is possible to achieve conceptual understanding and still retain the best traditions of traditional calculus. The book contains elements of reform, but within the context of a traditional curriculum.

在本书中，我的前提是，实现概念的理解的同时，保留传统的微积分内容。本书中包含了一些创新，但是都在传统的概念框架内。

I have written serval other calculus textbooks that might be preferable from some instructors. Most of them com in single variable and multivariable versions.

## 二、 To the student


致学生

Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a newspaper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don't be discouraged if you have to read a passage more than once in order to understand it. You should have pencil and paper and calculator at hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation.

阅读微积分教材和阅读报纸、小说、物理书籍不同，如果你第一次阅读时候，无法理解内容时候，请不要气馁，你应该准备好笔、纸、计算器，以便于画图或者计算。

Some students start by trying their homework problems and read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I suggest that a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look at the definitions to see the exact meanings of the terms.

有些学生会先尝试做作业题目，当他们遇到问题时候，才会想起查看教材。 我的建议是，在理解了课本的内容后，再去尝试解答课后习题。特别的，你应该先查看定义，了解术语的确切含义。

And before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the solution and try solving the problem youself. You'll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you do so.

在阅读每个习题后，我建议你自己尝试解答。如果你可以自己解答，你可以获取更多的内容。

Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logically. Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a connected, step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences—— not just a string of disconnected equations or formulas.

本课程的一个目标是，训练你的逻辑思考。学会按照逻辑的，一步一步的解答问题，而不是简单的带入一串孤立的方程或者公式。

The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the back of the book, in Appendix I. Some exercises ask for a verbal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, So don't worry that you haven't found the definitive answer. 

奇数编号的习题的答案可以在本书附录中找到答案，有些习题要求进行口头的解释、描述，在这些场景，没有单一的解答, 所以不要担心，你没有发现定义的解答。

In addition, there are oftenserveral different forms in which to express a numerically or algebraic answer so if you answer differs from mine, don't immediately assue you're wrong. For example, if the answer given in the back of the book is \\( \sqrt{2} - 1 \\) and you obtain \\( \frac{1} {(1 + \sqrt{2})} \\), then you're right and rationalizing the denominator will show that the answers are equivalent.

此外，可以用不同的形式来表达数值或者代数答案，如果你的答案和我的不同，不要立即认为是你错了，例如，如果书里面给出的答案是 \\( \sqrt{2} - 1 \\) ，而你的到的答案是 \\( \frac{1} {(1+ \sqrt{2})} \\) 那么你的答案也是正确的，因为这两个答案是相同的。


## 三、A preview of calculus

微积分简介

By the time you finish this course, you will be able to calculate the length of the curve used to design the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, detamine where a pilot should start descent for a smooth landing, compute the force on a baseball bat when it strikes the ball, and measure the amount of light sensed by the human eye as the pupil changes size.

当你完成这门课程时候，你将能够

1. 计算出用于设计圣路易斯门户拱门的曲线长度，

Calculus Is Fundamentally Different From the mathematics that you have studied previously: 

calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that approcah other quantities.

微积分和你之前学习的数学知识有根本的不同，微积分更多的是动态的，更少是静态的，它涉及到变化和运动，它处理接近其他数量的量。

For that reason it may be useful to have an overview of the subject before its intensive study. Here we give a glimpse of some of the main ideas of calculus by showing how to concept of a limit arises when we attempt to solve a variety of problems.

因此，在进入深入学习之前，先了解微积分的概述可能会更加有用。在这里，我们将通过展示如何解决各种问题，来介绍微积分的一些主要思想，从而展示极限的概念是如何产生的。


### 3.1 The area problem

面积问题

The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found areas using the "method of exhaustion." They Knew how to find the area A of any polygon by dividing it into trianles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles.

微积分的起源可以追溯到2500年前的古希腊，他们使用穷竭法来求解面积。他们知道通过将多边形分割为多个三角形，然后计算每一个三角形的面积，累加后，而从得到任意多边形的面积 A

It is a much more difficult problem to find the area of a curved figure. The Greek method of exhaustion was to inscribe polyons in the figure and circumscribe polygons about the figure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increse. Figure 2 illustrates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular polygons.
